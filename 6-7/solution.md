- This one asks us to find the file **somewhere in the server**
    - means its not necessarily in home, so we cd to `/` which is the servers directory
- We are then instructed to find a file owned by bandit7, group bandit6 and 33 bytes in size
    - we use the `find` command here as well
    - `find -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c`
- The result is quite extensive and most of the files say `permission denied`. Apart fro one file, which looks quite like what we want
    - `./var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password`
    - we `cat` it and found the password inside
- Password found
